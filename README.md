# C# Design Patterns Repository  

## 📌 Overview  

This repository is a practical exploration of **design patterns** in **C#**, implemented as a Visual Studio solution with multiple projects in solution folders. Each project demonstrates a specific design pattern, organized into categories (*Creational*, *Structural*, and *Behavioral*).  

I created this repository to:  
✅ **Learn** – Deepen my understanding of classic design patterns  
✅ **Implement** – Apply them in clean, practical C# examples  
✅ **Reference** – Build a catalog of patterns for future use  

## 🏗️ Repository Structure  

The solution uses **Visual Studio's virtual folders** (Solution Folders) to logically group patterns without cluttering the filesystem.  

### Categories:  
- **Creational Patterns** – How objects are created  
- **Structural Patterns** – How objects are composed  
- **Behavioral Patterns** – How objects communicate  

### Key Notes:  
🔹 Each pattern is in its own solution folder for clarity  
🔹 Examples follow simple cases 
🔹 Focus on **clean code** and **best practices**  

## ℹ️ Why Virtual Folders Don’t Appear on GitHub  

The grouping you see in **Visual Studio's Solution Explorer** is defined in the `.sln` file, but GitHub shows the **actual filesystem structure**. This means:  
- **In VS**: Folders like *"Creational Patterns"* help organize projects logically  
- **On GitHub**: Only the physical project folders appear (e.g., `Singleton/`, `FactoryMethod/`)  

## 🚀 How to Use This Repository  

1. **Clone the repo**  
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/csharp-design-patterns.git
   ```
2. **Open `DesignPatterns.sln`** in Visual Studio  
3. **Explore patterns** by category in Solution Explorer
